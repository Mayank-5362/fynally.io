- **Employment Phase**: Orange (`from-orange-500 to-orange-600`)

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Headings**: Bold weights (600-700)
- **Body Text**: Regular weight (400)
- **Emphasis**: Medium weight (500)

### Animations

- **Card Hover**: Scale and shadow transformations
- **Stagger Animations**: Sequential element reveals
- **Scroll Triggers**: Viewport-based animations

## Getting Started

Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ (or 22+)
- npm 10+

Install and run

```powershell
# From the project root
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173

Available scripts
- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – type-check and build for production
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint

## Project Structure

- `src/main.tsx` – App bootstrap with StrictMode and global styles
- `src/App.tsx` – Router and global layout (Navigation + Footer)
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` – responsive navbar with journey progress
- `src/components/Footer.tsx` – global footer with links and social icons
- `src/pages/*` – route pages: Home, StudentResources, Learning, Internships, Employment, About
- `src/index.css` – Tailwind entry and component utilities (buttons, gradients)
- `src/App.css` – app-wide custom styles and animations

## Pages Overview

- Home: hero, journey cards, stats, CTA
- Student Resources: study materials, scholarships, productivity tools, tips
- Learning: courses, mentorship programs, certifications
- Internships: searchable/filtered listings, success stories, guidance
- Employment: job listings with filters, candidate resources, employer programs
- About: mission, values, journey recap, impact, team, vision

## Styling & UI

- Design tokens in `tailwind.config.js` (primary, growth, ambition color scales)
- Utility classes plus a few component classes in `index.css`:
  - `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.journey-gradient`, `.card-hover`
- Accessible focus styles and semantic landmarks

## Routing

Routes are declared in `App.tsx` using React Router’s `Routes` and `Route` components. The navbar and footer persist across pages.

## Animations

Framer Motion powers entrance and scroll-triggered animations. Variants and transitions are defined inline per section for clarity.

## Development Notes

- Icons: import from `lucide-react`
- Placeholder images: `/api/placeholder/...` used as stand-ins
- Data: page lists use in-file arrays; replace with API calls later
- Theme hook: `useTheme` is a stub preserved for compatibility
