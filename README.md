## Styling & UI

- Design tokens in `tailwind.config.js` (primary, growth, ambition color scales)
- Utility classes plus a few component classes in `index.css`:
  - `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.journey-gradient`, `.card-hover`
- Accessible focus styles and semantic landmarks

## Routing

Routes are declared in `App.tsx` using React Router’s `Routes` and `Route` components. The navbar and footer persist across pages.

## Animations

Framer Motion powers entrance and scroll-triggered animations. Variants and transitions are defined inline per section for clarity.

## Development Notes

- Icons: import from `lucide-react`
- Placeholder images: `/api/placeholder/...` used as stand-ins
- Data: page lists use in-file arrays; replace with API calls later
- Theme hook: `useTheme` is a stub preserved for compatibility
